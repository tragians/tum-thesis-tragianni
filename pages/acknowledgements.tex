I would first like to warmly thank PD Dr. habil. Rudolph Triebel for the opportunity to conduct this master's thesis at the department of Perception and Cognition at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) on a topic that deeply inspired me.

I would also like to express my sincerest gratitude to
my advisors, Wout Boerdijk and Maximilian Durner, for their patience and continuous support throughout the past 6 months. Their guidance and targeted feedback, both on an academic and technical level, were invaluable for the successful completion of this work.

On a more personal note, I would like to thank my family, Nikos, Antonia and Kostas, and  my partner Andreas for their continuous love and support throughout the course of this master's program.
